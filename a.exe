Call for Placement officers (Please read the complete post/not a hiring post)

We are currently working with placement cells of few IITs/IIMs, large private universities and integrating the AI interviewer into their on campus job portals to make the shortlisting fair and less time consuming.

Our bandwidth will allow us to 18-20 more universities in January.

Interested cells can reach us out at contact@easecruit.com

We will review your stats and get back to you if your university falls under our criteria.

Kindly, don't mail me on my personal id.
